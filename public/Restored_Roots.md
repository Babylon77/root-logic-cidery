Restored Roots Furniture Business Plan
Executive Summary
Restored Roots Furniture is a part-time, family-run furniture restoration business operating from the upstairs of the bank barn on a 50-acre orchard in Wantage, NJ. Led by an experienced professional with a passion for woodworking, the business sources discarded wood furniture (e.g., Adirondack chairs, dining tables, chairs, dressers) from bulk trash pickup days and social media platforms (e.g., Facebook groups) in affluent communities around Kinnelon, NJ (household income $150,000+). Restored pieces are sold through Wantage and Kinnelon farmstands (60% of sales), online marketplaces (40%), and eventually small businesses (e.g., restaurants, boutiques). Operating 10 days/month for restoration and 2–3 days/month for sourcing, with family labor (three teenage children), the business projects 2026 revenues of $48,000 (240 pieces at $200 avg.) and an EBITDA of $34,800, scaling to $96,000 revenue by 2029 with hired help. Startup costs of $15,000 are funded by family cash, using the existing GMC Sierra for pickups/deliveries. The venture integrates with Colonial Cider’s website and farmstand, leveraging grassroots marketing and orchard insurance for low overhead.

Competitive Analysis

Morris Habitat for Humanity ReStore (Randolph, Morris County):
Model: Nonprofit selling donated furniture (antiques, cabinets, sofas) at discount prices to fund affordable housing. Accepts donations and offers pickup services.
Strengths: Large inventory, community goodwill, low prices ($50–$500), established since 2007.
Weaknesses: Broad focus (not just wood furniture), less emphasis on high-end restoration, nonprofit model limits premium pricing.
Differentiation: Restored Roots focuses on artisanal, high-quality wood restorations with a vintage aesthetic, targeting affluent buyers vs. ReStore’s bargain focus.


Heirloom Refinishing (Rockaway, Morris County):
Model: Full-service furniture refinishing since 1972, specializing in antiques and custom repairs in a 5,000 sq. ft. facility. Serves Morris, Sussex, and metro areas.
Strengths: 60+ years of experience, skilled craftsmen, high-end restorations (e.g., roll-top desks, piano benches), in-home estimates.
Weaknesses: Higher pricing ($500–$2,000+), less focus on upcycling discarded furniture, no integration with farm-based sales.
Differentiation: Restored Roots sources free furniture, offers mid-range pricing ($150–$1,200), and leverages farmstand/agritourism synergy.


Old World Furniture Restoration (Franklin Lakes, Bergen County):
Model: 60+ years of antique and furniture restoration, serving Sussex, Morris, Bergen, and Passaic. Operates from a workshop, focusing on heirlooms.
Strengths: Decades of expertise, personalized service, serves high-end clients in affluent areas.
Weaknesses: Limited pickup/delivery outside core areas, higher costs due to custom work, no upcycling of discarded furniture.
Differentiation: Restored Roots uses free sourcing, integrates with farm events, and targets broader consumer/small business markets.

Differentiation: Restored Roots’ low-cost sourcing and farm-based sales create competitive pricing and unique customer access.


Similar Models: No direct competitors in Morris/Sussex counties focus specifically on upcycling discarded furniture from bulk pickups for artisanal restoration. Most (e.g., Furniture Medic, Maxwell’s) focus on high-end antiques or commercial repairs, not free-sourced upcycling. Local junk removal services (e.g., Junkin’ Irishman, JunkDoctors) handle furniture disposal but do not restore, offering a sourcing opportunity.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths: Free sourcing, no rent (barn space), family labor, Kinnelon community ties, integration with Colonial Cider.
Weaknesses: Limited work schedule (12–13 days/month), reliance on variable furniture quality, initial equipment costs.
Opportunities: Growing demand for sustainable furniture, small business sales potential, online market expansion, farm event synergy.
Threats: Competition from established restorers, regulatory hurdles (e.g., bulk pickup permits), seasonal demand fluctuations.

Organization and Management

Ownership: Sole proprietorship under Colonial Cider LLC.
Key Team:
Owner/Operator: Your wife, leveraging woodworking skills and Kinnelon community ties for sourcing/sales.
Family Support: Three teenage children assist with pickups, sanding, manual labor (5–10 hours/month each).
Future Hiring: Part-time labor (1–2 workers, ~20 hours/month) by 2027 to scale production, allowing your wife to focus on management.
